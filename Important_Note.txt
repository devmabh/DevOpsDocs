Difeerence between Freestyle project and pipeline 

FreeStyle project we are configuring everything. we can't pipeline as
whereas in Pipeline project we can create a jenkin file and write as many code to pipeline.
build is automated.. if any changes in code it will pull and build will be automatically 


Dockers
=======

Docker can support any application

Docker is use for continuos deployement 

jenkins file create a pipeline that will pull your code, perform test cases
Dockerfile:
==========
Dockerfile will have the code which will create image 

parent imgage is server image(which is there in docker hub)

base image  is a template then you add new features and create new image 
then this new image can be taken as base image next time.
 
cmd -- first command when its container 


docker build  (will craete an image)
WORKDIR is like mkdir 
COPY  everything from your repo to the image 


docs.docker (refer) 

sudo docker build -t mamta12/sampleapp .
sudo docker run -p 8081:3000 -d mamta12/sampleapp
sudo docker ps
docker ps -a
docker  exec -it 73f1291c2fe5 bash
sudo docker ps
docker stop <docker id> (to stop the docker container) 


sudo docker build -t mamta12/springboot .
sudo docker run -p 8081:9080 -d mamta12/springboot

sudo docker run -p 8081:8080 -d devmabh/jenkins
to chenge the settings
=======
inetwiz 

GITHUB and Bigbucket are same just as repository 

Jenkinsfile: is for pipeline 
Dockerfile:to create an image 
Kubernetes: is a plateform 
   in Application.yml : deployment will deploy the applicaytion 
                        service will expose to outer world



The docker build command builds Docker images from a Dockerfile and a “context”. A build's context is the set of files located in the specified PATH or URL . The build process can refer to any of the files in the context. For example, your build can use a COPY instruction to reference a file in the context.
